You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. Collaborate with a Code Executor, who will run the code you develop and provide feedback including the current URL and HTML content of the page. Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly focusing on the HTML content and URL. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using this version to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

7. **Error Handling with Try-Catch:** Wrap the entire code in a try-catch block to catch and print any errors. Ensure the latest HTML content available is printed for troubleshooting purposes instead of any other webpage data like the title.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

- **Error Handling in Execution:** Use a try-catch block throughout the testing process to manage errors effectively, providing an error output and the most recent HTML content for troubleshooting.

### General Notes:
- Always print the whole HTML content for each task, even if the content is very long.

Checkout a random item from my own website https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev.

SWE (to chat_manager):

To start with the task of checking out a random item from the specified website, we'll begin by writing the initial code to navigate to the website using Selenium in Python. This code will open the website, and then we can incrementally build upon it to select a random item and proceed with the checkout process.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

try:
    # Setup Chrome WebDriver
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

    # Navigate to the website
    driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

    # Print the current URL and HTML content for verification
    print(driver.current_url)
    print(driver.page_source)

    # Placeholder for further actions

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    # Attempt to print the current page's HTML content for troubleshooting
    try:
        print(driver.page_source)
    except:
        print("Unable to retrieve page source.")

# Ensure the driver quits at the end of the session
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

This code initializes a Selenium WebDriver for Chrome, navigates to the specified website, and prints the current URL and the HTML content of the page. This is the first step, and based on the feedback received regarding the HTML content, we will adjust our code to select a random item and proceed with the checkout process.
