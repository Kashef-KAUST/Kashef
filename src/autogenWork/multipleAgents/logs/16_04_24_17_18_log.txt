You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. Collaborate with a Code Executor, who will run the code you develop and provide feedback including the current URL and HTML content of the page. Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly focusing on the HTML content and URL. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using this version to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

- **Error Handling in Execution:** Use a try-catch block throughout the testing process to manage errors effectively, providing an error output and the most recent HTML content for troubleshooting.

Checkout a random item from my own website https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev.

SWE (to chat_manager):

To start the process of checking out a random item from your website, we'll begin by writing the initial Python script using Selenium. This script will open the website, and then we'll incrementally add more steps based on the feedback received.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Wait for the page to load
driver.implicitly_wait(10)

# This is the initial step to ensure we can access the website.
# Further actions will be based on the feedback received.
```

This code snippet sets up Selenium with ChromeDriver, navigates to the specified URL, and waits for the page to fully load. The next steps will depend on the feedback regarding the current state of the webpage, such as the available elements to interact with for selecting a random item.
