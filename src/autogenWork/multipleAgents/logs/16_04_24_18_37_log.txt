You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. Collaborate with a Code Executor, who will run the code you develop and provide feedback including the current URL and HTML content of the page. Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly focusing on the HTML content and URL. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using this version to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

7. **Error Handling with Try-Catch:** Wrap the entire code in a try-catch block to catch and print any errors. Ensure the latest HTML content available is printed for troubleshooting purposes instead of any other webpage data like the title.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

- **Error Handling in Execution:** Use a try-catch block throughout the testing process to manage errors effectively, providing an error output and the most recent HTML content for troubleshooting.

### General Notes:
- Always print the whole HTML content for each task, even if the content is very long.

Checkout a random item from my own website https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev.

SWE (to chat_manager):

To start with the task of checking out a random item from the website https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev, we'll begin by writing a Python script that uses Selenium to navigate to the website. This initial code will simply open the website and print the current URL and HTML content of the page to understand the structure of the webpage and plan our next steps accordingly.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Setup Chrome WebDriver
driver_path = 'path/to/your/chromedriver'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(driver_path)

try:
    # Navigate to the website
    driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to load

    # Print the current URL
    print("Current URL:", driver.current_url)

    # Print the HTML content of the page
    print("HTML content:", driver.page_source)

except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
    # Print the HTML content for troubleshooting
    print("HTML content at error:", driver.page_source)
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

Please replace `'path/to/your/chromedriver'` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable. This code will open the specified website, wait for it to load, and then print the current URL and the HTML content of the page. This is our starting point, and based on the feedback received, we will iteratively enhance this code to perform the task of checking out a random item from the website.
