swe_system_message:

You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. You have two collaborators, a Code Executor and an HTML interpreter. The Code Executor will simply run the code you develop and provide feedback including errors or exception that might occur when executing the code. The HTML interpreter will provide you with the details of the HTML page so you can properly interact with the web application. Make sure you only click on elements that you have seen in the details of HTML content provided by the HTML interpreter.

Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly utilizing the HTML content. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

- **Version Tracking:** Maintain versions sequentially, ensuring that each new version of the script includes the functionalities of all previous versions, along with the new features being added.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using this version to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

### Example Workflow:

#### **Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content**

#### **Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element**

#### **Python Code Version 3: Fix NoSuchElementException**

#### **Python Code Version 4: Perform an Additional Action**

Checkout a random item from my own website https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev.

SWE (to chat_manager):

To start this task, we'll begin by writing the initial version of the Python script to access your website and print the HTML content of the homepage. This will help us understand the structure of the webpage and identify the elements we need to interact with for checking out a random item.

### Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import time

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Print the HTML content of the page
print(driver.page_source)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

This code initializes a Chrome browser session, navigates to the specified URL, waits for the page to load, prints the HTML content of the page, and then closes the browser. This is our starting point. Let's run this code to get the HTML content and proceed from there.

html (to chat_manager):

Based on the HTML content provided, to checkout a random item from the website, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Select a Random Product**: Identify and click on a random product from the "Hot Products" section.
2. **Add the Product to Cart**: Once on the product page, find the button to add the product to the cart.
3. **Navigate to the Cart**: Access the cart by clicking on the cart icon or link.
4. **Proceed to Checkout**: In the cart, find and click the button or link to proceed to checkout.

### Step 1: Select a Random Product

The products are listed within `<div class="col-md-4 hot-product-card">` elements. Each product has an anchor (`<a>`) tag wrapping an image, which leads to the product's page. To select a random product, we can choose one of these anchor tags by its class and click on it.

Example CSS Selector for a product link: `a[href^='/product/']`

### Step 2: Add the Product to Cart

On the product page, you'll need to look for a button or link to add the product to the cart. This button or link might have specific text like "Add to Cart" or be identified by a unique class or ID. Since the HTML of the product page is not provided, look for elements like `<button>` or `<a>` with text or attributes indicating an action to add items to the cart.

Example (hypothetical, as the exact HTML of the product page is not provided): `button.add-to-cart`

### Step 3: Navigate to the Cart

The cart can be accessed by clicking on the cart icon or link, which is identified in the provided HTML as follows:

CSS Selector for the cart link: `a.cart-link`

### Step 4: Proceed to Checkout

Within the cart page, there will be an option to proceed to checkout. This is typically a button or link with text such as "Checkout" or "Proceed to Checkout". Again, as the HTML content of the cart page is not provided, you'll need to identify this element based on its text content or specific class/ID.

Example (hypothetical, as the exact HTML of the cart page is not provided): `button.proceed-to-checkout`

### Note

Since I can't execute or interact with web pages directly, the above steps are based on common practices and the provided HTML structure. You'll need to adjust the selectors based on the actual HTML content of the product and cart pages.

Given the HTML content and the steps outlined, let's proceed with the first step of selecting a random product from the "Hot Products" section. We'll enhance our script to click on one of the product links randomly.

### Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element (Select a Random Product)

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import time
import random

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Find all product links in the "Hot Products" section
product_links = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.hot-product-card a")

# Select a random product link
random_product_link = random.choice(product_links)

# Click on the selected product link
random_product_link.click()

# Wait for the product page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Print the current URL to confirm navigation
print(driver.current_url)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

This code snippet now includes the logic to find all product links within the "Hot Products" section and clicks on one of them randomly. After clicking, it waits for the product page to load and prints the current URL to confirm that the navigation was successful. Let's run this code to ensure it works as expected before proceeding to the next steps.

SWE (to chat_manager):

The error `NoSuchWindowException` indicates that the target window was closed or not available when trying to interact with it. This is not the expected `NoSuchElementException`, which would indicate an issue with the selector. Instead, it seems like the browser window might have been closed or navigated away unexpectedly before the script could interact with the product links.

To address this issue, let's ensure that the browser window remains open and accessible throughout the execution of the script. We'll add some error handling to catch any exceptions that might cause the script to fail prematurely. Additionally, we'll ensure that the script waits adequately before attempting to interact with elements, which might help if the page is taking longer to load.

### Python Code Version 3: Add Error Handling and Ensure Window Availability

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
import time
import random

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

try:
    # Open the website
    driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

    # Wait for the page to load
    WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.hot-product-card a")))

    # Find all product links in the "Hot Products" section
    product_links = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.hot-product-card a")

    # Select a random product link
    random_product_link = random.choice(product_links)

    # Click on the selected product link
    random_product_link.click()

    # Wait for the product page to load
    WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button.add-to-cart")))

    # Print the current URL to confirm navigation
    print(driver.current_url)

finally:
    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()
```

In this version, we've added a `try-finally` block to ensure that the browser is closed properly even if an error occurs. We've also replaced the `time.sleep()` calls with `WebDriverWait` to wait explicitly for elements to be present before interacting with them, which should make the script more reliable. This approach uses explicit waits to wait for the presence of the product links and the add-to-cart button, ensuring that the elements are loaded before interaction.

Let's run this updated script to see if it resolves the issue and allows us to proceed with selecting a random product successfully.
