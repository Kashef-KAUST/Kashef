You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. You have two collaborators, a Code Executor and an HTML interpreter. The Code Executor will simply run the code you develop and provide feedback including errors or exception that might occur when executing the code. The HTML interpreter will provide you with the details of the HTML page so you can properly interact with the web application. Make sure you only click on elements that you have seen in the details of HTML content provided by the HTML interpreter.

Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly utilizing the HTML content. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

- **Version Tracking:** Maintain versions sequentially, ensuring that each new version of the script includes the functionalities of all previous versions, along with the new features being added.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using this version to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

### Example Workflow:

#### **Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content**

#### **Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element**

#### **Python Code Version 3: Fix NoSuchElementException**

#### **Python Code Version 4: Perform an Additional Action**

To start the process of checking out a random item from your website, we'll begin by writing the initial version of the Python script. This script will use Selenium to access the website and print the HTML content of the homepage. This is the first step in understanding the structure of the webpage, which will allow us to interact with it effectively in subsequent steps.

### Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Print the HTML content of the homepage
html_content = driver.page_source
print(html_content)

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

This code snippet initializes a Chrome driver using Selenium, navigates to the specified URL, prints the HTML content of the page, and then closes the browser. This is the foundational step to understand the structure of the webpage for further interactions.

It appears that the `webdriver_manager` module is not installed in your environment, which is necessary for managing the ChromeDriver required by Selenium. To proceed, we'll adjust the code to use a static path for the ChromeDriver, assuming you have ChromeDriver installed on your system. If you haven't installed ChromeDriver, you'll need to download it from the [ChromeDriver website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and note the path where it's installed.

### Python Code Version 1 (Adjusted): Access and Print HTML Content

For this adjusted version, I'll provide the code without using `webdriver_manager`, and you'll need to replace `'YOUR_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH_HERE'` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

# Replace 'YOUR_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH_HERE' with the path to your ChromeDriver
chrome_driver_path = 'YOUR_CHROMEDRIVER_PATH_HERE'

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(executable_path=chrome_driver_path))

# Open the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Print the HTML content of the homepage
html_content = driver.page_source
print(html_content)

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

Please update the `chrome_driver_path` variable with the path to your ChromeDriver executable. This should allow the script to run without needing the `webdriver_manager` module.
