Notes:
- run #4 and #10 (failed) : the html agent refused to analyze html code, saying something along the lines "I'm unable to execute or interact with web pages directly"
- The main reason for failing in this task was largely due to versioning. In subsequent code versions, the agent would discard the initial steps of creating the project which are necessary to create a to-do list item.
- In most of the cases, there were multiple code regenerations and LLM invocations to the occurance of several errors when interacting with the website.
