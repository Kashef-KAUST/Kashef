Notes: 
- run #7 (success): the number of LLM invocations because the swe optimized the last step of the task. Instead of printing the html to verify word count, it basically got the value of the word count by using the html selector and printed that value, thereby bypassing the html agent.
- run #10 (success): in this run the swe agent wrote the testing script twice. In the first test script, the swe agent did an arithmetic error in counting the words of its generated text, therefore concluding that the outputted word count from the website is incorrect. It then decided to test the functionality of the website again and succeeded in the second test script.
