Notes:
- run #4 (failed): the html agent refused to analyze the html, saying "I'm unable to execute or interact with web pages, scripts, or external systems directly, including performing actions like navigating web pages, clicking buttons, or completing forms on websites. My responses are based on the information provided to me and my programming capabilities are simulated through these interactions. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
