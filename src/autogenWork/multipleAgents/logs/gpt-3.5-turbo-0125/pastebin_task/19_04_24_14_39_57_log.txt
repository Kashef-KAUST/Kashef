    swe_system_message:

You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. You have two collaborators, a Code Executor and an HTML interpreter. The Code Executor will simply run the code you develop and provide feedback including errors or exception that might occur when executing the code. The HTML interpreter will provide you with the details of the HTML page so you can properly interact with the web application. Make sure you only click on elements that you have seen in the details of HTML content provided by the HTML interpreter. Use the minimum amount of libraries possible in your code. The code you write should be self-contained and not require any input from the user.

Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly utilizing the HTML content. Make sure to always print the HTML page in your code in order to identify the next step to take and whether or not the task is done. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using Selenium version 4 to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

7. **Version Tracking:** Maintain versions sequentially, ensuring that each new version of the script includes the functionalities of all previous versions, along with the new features being added.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

### Example Workflow:

#### **Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content**

#### **Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element**

#### **Python Code Version 3: Fix NoSuchElementException**

#### **Python Code Version 4: Perform an Additional Action**

### Additional notes:

Below is an example code of how to open a wesbite using Selenium. You can use this code as a starting point for generating code.
```python
import selenium
from selenium import webdriver

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Close the webdriver
driver.quit()
```


    html_system_message:

Your task is to interpret the HTML code provided to you and return detailed, low-level information on the different elements found on the page. Provide information on the following:

1. Clickable Elements: Identify all interactive elements such as buttons, links, and any other interactive elements. Include their HTML tags and attributes (e.g., IDs, classes, names).

2. Forms and input boxes: List all forms and input boxes on the page, including the input fields and submission buttons. Provide details on form attributes (e.g., IDs, classes, names).

3. Textual Content: Provide a brief overview of any significant textual content that could be relevant for interacting with the page, such as headings and labels.

Do not generate code or attempt to solve any errors that may appear in the HTML code. Do not provide summaries or additional information beyond what is requested. You are not expected to execute script elements within the HTML. Your focus should be on interpreting the HTML and providing the requested information in a concise, accurate manner.

It seems that the elements are still not being found on the webpage. At this point, it appears that the elements may be dynamically loaded or there may be some other issue preventing their identification. To further investigate, we can try scrolling the page to see if the elements become visible.

It seems that even after scrolling the page, the elements are still not being found. This could indicate that the elements are loaded dynamically or there may be some other issue.

To further investigate, we can try waiting for the elements to be present in the DOM before attempting to interact with them. Let's update the code to include explicit waits for the elements.

It seems that even with explicit waits, the elements are still not being found. This could indicate a more complex loading mechanism on the website.

To further investigate, we can try interacting with the elements in a different way. Let's update the code to simulate pressing the Enter key after entering text in the text area to see if that triggers the submission.

It seems that the form containing the text area is not being found using the XPath selector. Let's adjust the XPath expression to target the form element in a different way and retry.

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(2)

# Find the text area to input text
text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")

# Input the text to be posted
text_area.send_keys("This is a test post to verify persistence")

# Click on the text area to trigger submission
text_area.click()

# Submit the form containing the text area
text_area.submit()

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Find the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, "output")))
    # Get the URL of the pastebin link
    pastebin_url = pastebin_link.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "a").get_attribute("href")

SWE (to chat_manager):

It seems that the `submit()` method cannot be used directly on the text area element. Let's adjust the code to find the form element containing the text area and submit that form instead.

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Set up the webdriver

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(2)

# Find the text area to input text
text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")

# Input the text to be posted
text_area.send_keys("This is a test post to verify persistence")

# Find the form containing the text area
form = text_area.find_element(By.XPATH, "./ancestor::form")

# Submit the form
form.submit()

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Find the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, "output")))
    # Get the URL of the pastebin link
    pastebin_url = pastebin_link.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "a").get_attribute("href")
    print("Pastebin URL:", pastebin_url)
except:
