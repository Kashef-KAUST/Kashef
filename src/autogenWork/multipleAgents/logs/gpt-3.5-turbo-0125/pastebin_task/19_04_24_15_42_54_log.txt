    swe_system_message:

You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. You have two collaborators, a Code Executor and an HTML interpreter. The Code Executor will simply run the code you develop and provide feedback including errors or exception that might occur when executing the code. The HTML interpreter will provide you with the details of the HTML page so you can properly interact with the web application. Make sure you only click on elements that you have seen in the details of HTML content provided by the HTML interpreter. Use the minimum amount of libraries possible in your code. The code you write should be self-contained and not require any input from the user.

Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly utilizing the HTML content. Make sure to always print the HTML page in your code in order to identify the next step to take and whether or not the task is done. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using Selenium version 4 to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

7. **Version Tracking:** Maintain versions sequentially, ensuring that each new version of the script includes the functionalities of all previous versions, along with the new features being added.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

### Example Workflow:

#### **Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content**

#### **Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element**

#### **Python Code Version 3: Fix NoSuchElementException**

#### **Python Code Version 4: Perform an Additional Action**

### Additional notes:

Below is an example code of how to open a wesbite using Selenium. You can use this code as a starting point for generating code.
```python
import selenium
from selenium import webdriver

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Close the webdriver
driver.quit()
```


    html_system_message:

Your task is to interpret the HTML code provided to you and return detailed, low-level information on the different elements found on the page. Provide information on the following:

1. Clickable Elements: Identify all interactive elements such as buttons, links, and any other interactive elements. Include their HTML tags and attributes (e.g., IDs, classes, names).

2. Forms and input boxes: List all forms and input boxes on the page, including the input fields and submission buttons. Provide details on form attributes (e.g., IDs, classes, names).

3. Textual Content: Provide a brief overview of any significant textual content that could be relevant for interacting with the page, such as headings and labels.

Do not generate code or attempt to solve any errors that may appear in the HTML code. Do not provide summaries or additional information beyond what is requested. You are not expected to execute script elements within the HTML. Your focus should be on interpreting the HTML and providing the requested information in a concise, accurate manner.

It seems that the submit button and pastebin link elements are not being found on the page. This could be due to changes in the HTML structure or timing issues. Let's adjust the code to wait for the elements to be present before interacting with them. 

Here is the updated code:

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(2)

# Find the text area element to input text
text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")

# Input text to be posted
text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)

# Find the submit button and click to post the text
try:
    submit_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "send")))
    submit_button.click()
except:
    print("Submit button not found")

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Get the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, "output"))).get_attribute("value")
    print("Pastebin Link:", pastebin_link)
except:
    print("Pastebin link not found")

# Close the webdriver

``` 

Please try running this updated code to see if it can successfully find and interact with the elements on the page.

It seems that the elements are still not being found on the page. Let's try a different approach by using a different method to locate the elements. We can try using `find_element_by_xpath` instead of `find_element` with `By.ID`.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website

# Wait for the page to load

# Find the text area element to input text
text_area = driver.find_element_by_id("message")

# Input text to be posted
text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)

# Find the submit button and click to post the text
try:
    submit_button = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//button[@id='send']")
    submit_button.click()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Submit button not found")

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Get the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = driver.find_element_by_id("output").get_attribute("value")
    print("Pastebin Link:", pastebin_link)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Pastebin link not found")

# Close the webdriver

It seems that the submit button is not interactable, which could be due to various reasons such as the element being covered, disabled, or not in the expected state for interaction. Let's add a wait condition to ensure the button is clickable before attempting to click on it.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(2)

# Find the text area element to input text
try:
    text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")
    text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
    text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Text area not found")

# Find the submit button and click to post the text
try:
    submit_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']")))
    submit_button.click()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Submit button not found")
except:
    print("Submit button not clickable")

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Get the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = driver.find_element(By.ID, "output").get_attribute("value")
    print("Pastebin Link:", pastebin_link)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Pastebin link not found")

# Close the webdriver
driver.quit()
```

Please try running this updated code to see if it can successfully interact with the elements on the page.

It seems that the submit button is not clickable. Let's try one more approach by scrolling to the submit button before attempting to click on it. This may help make the button interactable.

Here is the updated code:

```python

from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(2)

# Find the text area element to input text
try:
    text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")
    text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
    text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Text area not found")

# Find the submit button and scroll to it
try:
    submit_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']")
    actions = ActionChains(driver)
    actions.move_to_element(submit_button).perform()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Submit button not found")

# Click the submit button
try:
    submit_button.click()
except:
    print("Submit button not clickable")

# Wait for the post to be submitted
time.sleep(2)

# Get the generated pastebin link
try:
    pastebin_link = driver.find_element(By.ID, "output").get_attribute("value")
    print("Pastebin Link:", pastebin_link)
except NoSuchElementException:

It seems that the element is still not interactable even after attempting to scroll to it. Let's simplify the approach and directly try clicking on the submit button without scrolling to it.

Here is the updated code:

```python

# Set up the webdriver

# Find the text area element to input text
try:
    text_area = driver.find_element(By.ID, "message")
    text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
    text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Text area not found")

# Find the submit button and click to post the text
try:
    submit_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']")
    submit_button.click()
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Submit button not found")

# Wait for the post to be submitted

It seems that the element is still not interactable. Let's try one more approach by using JavaScript to click on the submit button directly.

Here is the updated code:

```python

# Set up the webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://privatebin.net")

    text_to_post = "This is a test post to verify persistence"
    text_area.send_keys(text_to_post)
except NoSuchElementException:
    print("Text area not found")

# Find the submit button and click to post the text using JavaScript
try:
    submit_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']")
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", submit_button)
