You are a Software Testing Engineer tasked with generating testing code for web applications. You have two collaborators, a Code Executor and an HTML interpreter. The Code Executor will simply run the code you develop and provide feedback including errors or exception that might occur when executing the code. The HTML interpreter will provide you with the details of the HTML page so you can properly interact with the web application. Make sure you only click on elements that you have seen in the details of HTML content provided by the HTML interpreter. Use the minimum amount of libraries possible in your code. The code you write should be self-contained and not require any input from the user.

Your goal is to conduct thorough and effective testing by adhering to these guidelines:

1. **Sequential Task Execution:** Handle tasks sequentially. After submitting code and receiving feedback, proceed to the next task.

2. **Incremental Code Development:** Always start with code that access the website first and enhance your code iteratively based on feedback received, particularly utilizing the HTML content. Make sure to always print the HTML page in your code in order to identify the next step to take and whether or not the task is done. At no point should you change or remove any previously written code that did not result in an error.

3. **Dynamic Selector Adjustment:** If encountering a `NoSuchElementException`, adjust your element selectors based on the most recent HTML content.

4. **Accurate Element Identifier Usage:** Use identifiers from the HTML content to ensure your Selenium functions interact with the correct webpage elements.

5. **Selenium Library Version 4 Compliance:** Develop your testing code using Selenium version 4 to ensure compatibility.

6. **Proactive Error Handling and Code Modification:** Modify your code as necessary based on execution errors or updated HTML feedback. Only change or remove code that has directly led to errors; otherwise, build upon existing code.

7. **Version Tracking:** Maintain versions sequentially, ensuring that each new version of the script includes the functionalities of all previous versions, along with the new features being added.

### Development Workflow:

- **Objective:** Incrementally develop a Python script to perform tasks on a web page, progressing from basic functionalities to complex interactions.

- **Iterative Development:** Build upon each step with the latest feedback, ensuring each task is fully executed according to the prompt instructions.

### Example Workflow:

#### **Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content**

#### **Python Code Version 2: Interact with a Page Element**

#### **Python Code Version 3: Fix NoSuchElementException**

#### **Python Code Version 4: Perform an Additional Action**

SWE (to chat_manager):

To begin the task of checking out a random item from the specified website, we'll start with the first version of the Python script. This initial version will focus on accessing the website and printing its HTML content to understand its structure and identify the elements we need to interact with for completing the checkout process.

### Python Code Version 1: Access and Print HTML Content

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open the specified URL
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Print the HTML content of the page
print(driver.page_source)

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

This code initializes a Chrome WebDriver, navigates to the provided URL, prints the HTML content of the page, and then closes the browser. This will help us understand the structure of the webpage and identify the next steps for interacting with the page elements to complete the checkout process.

SWE (to chat_manager):

It appears that the `webdriver_manager` module is not installed in your environment, which is necessary for managing the ChromeDriver required for Selenium to interact with the Chrome browser. To proceed without requiring additional installations and to keep the use of libraries to a minimum, I'll adjust the code to use a more direct approach that doesn't rely on `webdriver_manager`.

### Python Code Version 1 (Revised): Access and Print HTML Content

Let's revise the script to avoid using `webdriver_manager`. This version assumes that ChromeDriver is already installed and its path is correctly set in the system's PATH environment variable. If it's not, you'll need to download ChromeDriver and set it up accordingly.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

# Initialize the Chrome driver (Assuming ChromeDriver's path is set in the system's PATH)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the specified URL
driver.get("https://cymbal-shops.retail.cymbal.dev")

# Print the HTML content of the page
print(driver.page_source)

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

This script should work if ChromeDriver is correctly set up in your environment. It will access the website and print its HTML content, allowing us to proceed with identifying the elements for the checkout process.
